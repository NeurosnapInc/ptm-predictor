# Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) Predictor
This project aims to fine-tune a **protein language model (pLM)** to predict the probabilities of various **post-translational modifications (PTMs)** occurring at specific positions within a protein sequence. By leveraging deep learning, we seek to enhance our ability to identify PTM sites, ultimately aiding in protein function annotation, drug discovery, and disease research.

## üî• Motivation
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are essential biochemical alterations that regulate protein function, stability, and interactions. These modifications influence nearly every cellular process and play a crucial role in diseases like cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune disorders. Despite their importance, **accurately predicting PTM sites remains a major challenge** due to the complexity and variability of modifications.

### Why contribute?
- **Advance scientific discovery**: Help build an open-source tool that improves our ability to identify and understand PTMs.
- **Improve protein function prediction**: Many functional annotations rely on accurate PTM site predictions.
- **Enhance drug discovery**: PTM dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, and better prediction methods can assist in drug target identification.
- **Collaborate with experts**: Work with bioinformatics and machine learning researchers on cutting-edge problems.

## üöÄ Project Goals
- **Fine-tune a pLM model**: Adapt a foundation protein language model for PTM site prediction.
- **Create a benchmark dataset**: Curate high-quality training data from existing PTM databases.
- **Improve accuracy & generalizability**: Develop robust prediction methods across different protein families and organisms.
- **Open collaboration**: Build an accessible and community-driven tool for researchers.
